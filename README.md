# Persian Language Speech Processing using NLP

This project focuses on Natural Language Processing (NLP) for the Persian language, with a particular emphasis on speech processing. The goal is to extract meaningful insights from Persian text data and implement speech-to-text conversion to enhance understanding of Persian syntax and grammar.

## Project Overview

The project utilizes several NLP techniques, such as:
- **Tokenization**: Splitting Persian text into smaller units (words, sentences, etc.) for analysis.
- **Lemmatization**: Reducing words to their base or dictionary form using the **Hazm** library, tailored specifically for Persian language processing.
- **Text Analysis**: Conducting a detailed analysis of Persian texts to extract patterns and insights from the language.

The ultimate goal of this project is to combine text analysis with speech processing to enable accurate speech-to-text conversion for Persian, improving comprehension of the languageâ€™s unique syntactic and grammatical rules.

## Key Features

- **Speech-to-Text Conversion**: Implements a speech recognition system that converts Persian audio to text.
- **Text Analysis**: Extracts useful insights from the Persian text using NLP methods.
- **Persian Syntax & Grammar Processing**: Aims to enhance the understanding of the language by focusing on its structure and grammar.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The main programming language used for the project.
- **Hazm Library**: A Python library specifically designed for processing Persian text. It includes functionalities for tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and part-of-speech tagging.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: For analyzing and processing the Persian language.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/persian-nlp-speech-processing.git
Install the required Python libraries:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Prepare your Persian text or speech data.

Run the main processing script:

bash
Copy code
python process_speech.py --input your_audio_file.wav
View the extracted text and insights:

bash
Copy code
python analyze_text.py --input extracted_text.txt
Results
The program outputs:

Converted text from speech in the Persian language.
Analysis of the syntax, grammar, and structure of the processed text.
Future Work
Improve the accuracy of speech recognition using deep learning models.
Expand the system to handle larger datasets and more complex Persian grammar structures.
